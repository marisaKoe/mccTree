# mccTree



This program computes the mcc tree out of a list of trees (bootstrap replicates or posterior samples) described in chapter 4 in Köllner (2021).

Please note: to run this program you need your own list of trees (bootstrap replicates or posterior samples) and add the appropriate information to the main.py
